# Arqanum

Arqanum is a messenger built with one primary goal: maximum cryptographic security, including resistance to attacks from quantum computers.

The application does not use or require any personal data — no email, no phone number, not even a password. Instead, identity and authentication are entirely based on ML-DSA (Dilithium5) signatures.

Every message is encrypted using a unique AES-GCM key, generated separately via ML-KEM for each message.

Arqanum is designed as a post-quantum secure communication architecture — offering zero compromise on privacy and long-term cryptographic resilience.
